Here is how to deploy a Nuxt 3 project on GitHub Pages:

# How to

1. Install dev dependency `gh-pages`
2. Add the script `"deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"` in package.json file
3. Specifiy router base in nuxt.config.ts.
4. Generate with `npm run generate`
5. Deploy with `npm run deploy`

Your site is live at https://ptit9x.github.io/nuxt-github-pages/

Router config:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  router: {
    base: '/nuxt-github-pages/' // base: '/<repository>/'
  }
}
```

# What it does

The dependency will copy your dist content to a specific `gh-pages` branch that will be served by GitHub Pages. If you go to your Settings/Pages, youâ€™ll see the active branch for your site.

The site is accessible on `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`. For this repository, the site is https://lucpotage.github.io/nuxt-github-pages/.

You can rely on GitHub Actions too. More info here: https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/ci-cd-with-github-actions-to-deploy-on-github-pages-73e225f8f131
